# Avalanche Insurance – AI-Powered, On‑Chain Parametric Claims

## 1. Title & One‑Liner
- "Avalanche Insurance: AI‑assisted claims and instant, trustless payouts on Avalanche."

## 2. Problem
- Traditional insurance claims are slow (weeks/months), costly (10–20% loss adjustment expense), and opaque.
- Web3 users face event risks (protocol, validator, weather/cat) but lack fast, trustworthy, global coverage.
- Evidence review and fraud detection are labor‑intensive; payouts require centralized discretion.

## 3. Solution
- AI‑assisted claim analysis + parametric smart contracts for near‑instant decisions and on‑chain payouts.
- Evidence stored on IPFS; analysis logged on‑chain for transparency.
- Users claim from a wallet; approved payouts stream directly from a treasury via `PayoutManager`.

## 4. Why Now (Avalanche Advantage)
- Sub‑second finality and low fees enable micro‑coverage and global access.
- Chainlink data + Avalanche throughput → scalable parametric triggers.
- Maturing AI models improve evaluation quality and explainability.

## 5. Product Overview
- Frontend (Vite + React): simple policy dashboard, file claim, analyze, withdraw.
- Backend (Node/Express): orchestrates AI, IPFS, and on‑chain calls; exposes REST API.
- Smart Contracts (Solidity): `PolicyRegistry`, `ClaimsProcessor`, `PayoutManager` manage policies, decisions, and payouts.

> - Backend: http://localhost:3331 (health: /api/health)

## 6. How It Works
1) User buys/holds a policy in `PolicyRegistry`.
2) On incident, user submits claim + evidence (UI → IPFS).
3) Backend invokes AI evaluation and proposes a result (with rationale).
4) `ClaimsProcessor` records decision on‑chain.
5) If Approved, `PayoutManager` releases funds; user withdraws in one click.

Architecture refs:
- Contracts: `contracts/*.sol`
- Backend API: `backend/src/index.js` (routes: `/api/claims`, `/api/users`, `/api/config`, `/api/health`)
- Frontend calls: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

## 7. Differentiation
- AI‑assisted triage with on‑chain transparency (model outputs, rationale, and tx hashes).
- Parametric and discretionary modes; plug‑and‑play oracles (Chainlink) for objective triggers.
- Modular: swap AI provider, oracle feeds, payout curves without app rewrite.

## 8. Target Users & Market
- DeFi users, validators, node operators (slashing/uptime coverage).
- NFT/game studios (delivery/event failures), travel/weather micro‑covers.
- TAM: Multi‑billion global parametric insurance; initial beachhead in Web3 incident covers.

## 9. Business Model
- Premiums (fixed + risk‑adjusted) with protocol fee (1–3%).
- Claim processing fee (AI/op‑ex) netted on approval.
- B2B SDK/API for partners (dApps, wallets, exchanges) with rev‑share.

## 10. Traction (to‑date / plan)
- PoC live: contracts deployed (Fuji), end‑to‑end claim flow working locally.
- Next 90 days: pilot with 2–3 Web3 partners; ship mainnet v1; integrate pinning + analytics.
- KPIs: claim time < 5 min, CSAT > 4.5/5, loss ratio < 70%, fraud rate < 3%.

## 11. Technology
- Chain: Avalanche (Fuji → Mainnet). Chainlink for data feeds.
- Storage: IPFS (pinning service planned). Evidence hashing on‑chain.
- AI: provider‑agnostic; currently Gemini via `@google/generative-ai`.
- Security: role‑based admin, rate‑limited API, CORS, auditable decisions.

## 12. Roadmap
- Q1: Mainnet launch, pinning service, upgrade to `multer@2.x`, observability and SLOs.
- Q2: Parametric catalog (weather, slashing, oracle outages), partner SDK.
- Q3: Capital pool optimization, reinsurance lines, multi‑chain expansion.

## 13. Go‑To‑Market
- Integrations with wallets/dApps (claim widget and policy SDK).
- Incentivized pilots with loss subsidies; validators/infra as lighthouse accounts.
- Content + incident dashboards to drive awareness and trust.

## 14. Competition
- On‑chain insurance protocols (e.g., Nexus Mutual), Trad parametric players.
- Our edge: AI‑assisted explainable decisions + instant on‑chain execution on Avalanche.

## 15. Team & Advisors
- Smart contracts, AI/ML, and actuarial risk backgrounds.
- Seeking Avalanche/Chainlink advisors for oracle design and capital efficiency.

## 16. Ask (What We Need to Win)
- Grants: Avalanche/Chainlink integration, audit support.
- Partnerships: oracle data, validator networks, Web3 apps for pilot covers.
- Capital: seed for risk capital bootstrap and engineering hires.

## 17. Live Demo Script
1) Connect wallet (Fuji).
2) File a claim with sample evidence → tx appears on Snowtrace.
3) Click “Analyze Claim” → AI rationale populated; on‑chain status updates.
4) If Approved, click “Withdraw AVAX” → payout confirmed on Snowtrace.

## 18. Screens & Links
- Dashboard, Claim Filing, Claim Detail + AI, Withdraw.
- Repo: local workspace. Health: `GET /api/health`.

## 19. Risks & Mitigations
- Model error → human override + parametric triggers for objective events.
- Capital adequacy → conservative reserves + reinsurance partners.
- Data integrity → IPFS + on‑chain hashes; restricted file types/sizes.
